This was one of the very first sophisticated swing based tool I ever 
wrote more than two years ago. Also , I didn't know much about 
rdf+xml/foaf at this time.

Here are the things I would do:

* use StaX instead of DOM to parse RDF
* better RDF/FOAF compliance
* cache for pictures
* integrate the also-old scifoaf (fetch pubmed articles and ) save rdf
* change Namespaces.RDF,Namespaces.FOAF  to RDF.NS, FOAF.NS, etc...
